- Two new concepts:
  - AsyncStore (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context)
    - Still stage 2
      May be valid javascript implementation is not yet standardized
  - Tagged template strings
    - We'll make heavy use of this in the future (css, html, sql, etc.)
- Using only node apis. This could run in node.
- No dependencies (except for typescript)
